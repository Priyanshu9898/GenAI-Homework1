<!-- I am **Priyanshu Malaviya** (Unity ID: **pmlavi**). This repository contains my work for Homework 01 in CSC 591: Foundations of Generative AI for Systems (Spring 2025). The assignment focuses on evaluating various cache replacement policies using AI-driven methods, comparing classical approaches (like LRU and Beladyâ€™s optimal policy) with learned models (MLP, RNN, LSTM).

## Repository Structure

- **Training_scripts/**  
  Contains scripts for training models on different cache replacement scenarios.

- **eval_scripts/**  
  Holds scripts for running evaluation jobs on trained models.

- **training_logs/**  
  Stores logs produced during the training phase.

- **eval_logs/**  
  Contains logs generated from evaluation jobs.

- **graphs/**  
  Includes visual representations, charts, and figures showing performance metrics.

- **tensorboard/**  
  Holds TensorBoard logs for tracking and visualizing model training progress.

- **pmalavi_CSC591_HW1.pdf**  
  The main PDF report detailing experiments and results.

- **README.md**  
  This file.
