## Overview

This assignment evaluates various cache replacement policies using both traditional methods (like LRU and Beladyâ€™s optimal policy) and AI-driven approaches (including MLP, RNN, and LSTM models).

## Repository Structure

- **Training_scripts/**: Scripts used for training the models.
- **eval_scripts/**: Scripts used for evaluating model performance.
- **training_logs/**: Logs generated during the training phase.
- **eval_logs/**: Logs generated during evaluation runs.
- **graphs/**: Visualizations and charts summarizing the results.
- **tensorboard/**: Logs for monitoring training progress via TensorBoard.
- **pmalavi_CSC591_HW1.pdf**: The detailed report documenting the experimental setup, results, and analysis.

## How to Use
